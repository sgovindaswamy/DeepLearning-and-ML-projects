## ANAMOLY DETECTION

This section shows implementation of anamoly detection algorithm on the Ai4i2020 dataset from the UCI machine learning repository. Here is the official link for the dataset : https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/601/ai4i+2020+predictive+maintenance+dataset

After reducing the dimensionality using dimensionality reduction technique such as Principal Component Analysis, The anamoly detection algorithms that have been implemented are as follows, 

#Isolation Forest
#Density based spatial clustering
#One-class SVM
#Local outlier factor

These algorithms displayed poor performance on the test set, however the Random forest classifier and AutoEncoders showed promising results with an F1 score of 78%
